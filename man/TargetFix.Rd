\title{Target fixation data from a typical "visual world paradigm" experiment}
\format{A data frame with 300 rows and 7 variables
\describe{
\item{Subject}{subject ID, factor}
\item{Time}{time (in ms) relative to word onset in 50ms bins, 300-1000}
\item{timeBin}{rescaling of Time variable for easier model-fitting, 1-15}
\item{Condition}{word frequency condition: High (e.g., torch, frog) or Low (e.g., class, horse)}
\item{meanFix}{fixation proportion (subject mean): proportion of correct-response trials on which the object was fixated}
\item{sumFix}{fixation sum: number of correct-response trials on which the object was fixated (i.e., numerator for meanFix)}
\item{N}{number of correct-response trials (i.e., denominator for meanFix)}
}}
