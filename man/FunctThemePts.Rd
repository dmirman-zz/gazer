\title{Fixation of semantically related objects during spoken word comprehension by participants with left hemisphere stroke}
\format{A data frame with 8199 rows and 8 variables:
\describe{
\item{Subject}{subject ID, factor}
\item{Condition}{semantic relatedness condition: Function (e.g., broom - sponge) or Thematic (e.g., broom - dustpan)}
\item{Object}{object type: Target, semantically related Competitor, or Unrelated}

\item{Time}{time (in ms) relative to word onset in 50ms bins; negative numbers indicate preview period (visual display before word onset)}
\item{meanFix}{fixation proportion (subject mean): proportion of correct-response trials on which the object was fixated}
\item{sumFix}{fixation sum: number of correct-response trials on which the object was fixated (i.e., numerator for meanFix)}
\item{N}{number of correct-response trials (i.e., denominator for meanFix)}
